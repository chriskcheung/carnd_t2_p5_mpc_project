    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a Model Predictive Control (MPC) model to drive the vehicle around the track. The model processes a series of sensor data (ptsx,ptsy,x,y,psi,v,cte,epsi) to track the reference path and to predict the vehichle drive path. IPOPT library is used to optimize the control inputs. Similar to pervious projects in Term2, the MPC model is connected to a simulator via uWebSocketIO with waypoints of the reference path.\n",

    "##### main.cpp\n",
    "establishes communication between simulator and PF model using uWebSocketIO, and reads in data during set time intervals. Coordinates transform from global coordinate system to vehicle coordinates is needed for the way points of the reference path to be useful for finding the coefficient of line fitting using polyfit(). Sensor measurements and coefficient of fitted line are fed to MPC::Solve() for predicting and optimizing the actuation inputs. \n",

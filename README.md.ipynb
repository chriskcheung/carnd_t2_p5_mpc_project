    "### Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a Model Predictive Control (MPC) model to drive the vehicle around the track. The model processes a series of sensor data (ptsx,ptsy,x,y,psi,v,cte,epsi) to track the reference path and to predict the vehichle drive path. IPOPT library is used to optimize the control inputs. Similar to pervious projects in Term2, the MPC model is connected to a simulator via uWebSocketIO with waypoints of the reference path.\n",

    "establishes communication between simulator and PF model using uWebSocketIO, and reads in data during set time intervals. Coordinates transform from global coordinate system to vehicle coordinates is needed for the way points of the reference path to be useful for finding the coefficient of line fitting using polyfit(). Sensor measurements and coefficient of fitted line are fed to MPC::Solve() for predicting and optimizing the actuation inputs. \n",

    "### Handling latency\n",
    "In the idle world, MPC provides a instant actuation control prediction with sensor telemetry input. However, in the real world, the predicted actuation control takes time to propagate through the machanical parts to reflect to the actual turnning. To deal with latency, I choose to update the state vector elements to determine the future position of px, py, and the vehicle orientation psi in the delta time of 100ms. The delayed state vectors is then used for transforming the waypoints to coordinate. This provides that the transformed coordinates are representing the delayed referring point of px, and py.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original solution updated the state vectors with MPC model equations with dt=100ms before feeding into polyfit, hoping the coefficents of fitted curve would reflect the latency. However, the solution didn't totally work with my AWS remote VM setup while running simulator locally in my laptop. Some none zero network latency may have contributed to the inputs telemetries from simulator, which throw off the same MPC model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In my latest solution, I handled the latency after polyfit but before MPC.solve(), with the assumption that px, py and psi were reset to 0 due to transforming to vehicle coordinates, as if vehicle was the new origin. The result seemed much better this time. \n",
